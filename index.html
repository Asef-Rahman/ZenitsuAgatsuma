<h3>    Zenitsu is from an anime named "Demon Slayer" (Kimetsu no Yaiba). He is a young man at the age of 16 and is friends with the protagonist: Tanjiro Kamado. Zeitsu and Tanjiro met when Zenitsu was begging for a girl to stay with him, as he never wanted the job of demon slayer. Zenitsu would not let go of the girl and Tanjiro pryed the girl from his grip. Zenitsu was crying while he was begging, but the mood was really funny for us viewers. Zenitsu later turns out to be a person that gets scared easily, for example, in the first mission he had with Tanjiro, he would try to get out of the mansion they were in with a boy. As Tanjiro and Zenitsu were separated due to a Blood Demon Art (a demon's magic), Tanjiro had a small girl while he looked for the demon, while Zenitsu had a young boy, about 10 years old, trying to get out. The demon inside had kidnapped the boy and the girl's older brother. The kidnapped boy had a rare blood type that gave the density of 50-200 human blood, and is extremely rare. The demon wanted to prove himself to the King Demon Muzan that he could be his 12 henchmen/henchwomen (also known as the 12 kizuki [demon moons]). In the end Tanjiro beat the demon. Meanwhile, Zenitsu met a demon with an unusually long tongue, which might have been a clue to what demon art he might have. Zenitsu fainted on the spot when the demon said he would lick the marrow of his bones. They boy with him strted to call for him to wake up. Zenitsu woke up a second before the demon attacked, his sword in case but held by his hand, he gave a serious aura. The demon shot his toungue towards them but Zenitsu had already decapitated his head with his sword, using his breath form: Thunder Breathing. He only knows one move as he was shot by lightning once and he is know a part of the element. The form (the form that he can use)'s full name is: Thunder Breathing: First Form: Thunderclap and Flash. Japanese: Kaminari no Kokyu: Ichi no kate Hekireki Issen. For more information, you can watch the anime, read the manga or just read the source below:
